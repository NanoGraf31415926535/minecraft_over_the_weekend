#### Building

##### Unix-like

`$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NanoGraf31415926535/minecraft_over_the_weekend.git `

`$ make`

The following static libraries under `lib/` must be built before the main project can be built:

- GLAD `lib/glad/src/glad.o`
- CGLM `lib/cglm/.libs/libcglm.a`
- GLFW `lib/glfw/src/libglfw3.a`
- libnoise `lib/noise/libnoise.a`

All of the above have their own Makefile under their respective subdirectory and can be built with `$ make libs`.

If libraries are not found, ensure that submodules have been cloned.

The game binary, once built with `$ make`, can be found in `./bin/`.

*Be sure* to run with `$ ./bin/game` out of the root directory of the repository.
If you are getting "cannot open file" errors (such as "cannot find ./res/shaders/*.vs"), this is the issue.

##### Windows

You might have better luck building under WSL with an X environment to pass graphics through. Otherwise, good luck! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
